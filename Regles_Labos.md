# WORK IN GROUPS
You will work on the labs in groups of two or three.  
Each member of a group has to participate in all of the lab's implementation steps.

# LAB REPORT
When a lab report is asked for begin the report with the lab's title, your names and the date.

You can write the lab report in plain text format and you are encouraged to use Markdown.  
However write the report with the same care for structure and formatting as you would with a word processor.  
You can also submit the report in PDF format.

# SUBMISSION
You submit your lab results in a zip archive on Cyberlearn.  
The filename of the archive must follow the pattern LabX_FamilyName1_FirstName1_FamilyName2_FirstName2.zip.

The archive must contain:

- The source code
- The test procedure and its results
- The report (if required)
- Any other files needed to document your lab results  

Your lab results must be submitted at the latest on the date and time indicated in Cyberlearn.

# LATE SUBMISSIONS
Make sure you respect the submission dedlines.  
If you submit late the following penalties will be applied:  

- 1 point is subtracted from the grade for the first penalty
- 0.5 point is subtracted for the following penalites, every 24 hours
- Be aware that one minute late is already a missed deadline!

# FAIR PLAY
Work on a lab is done collaboratively in a group, but collaboration between groups is not permitted.  
Any copying, be it between groups in your class, in a parallel class or a class from previous semesters will result in a grade of 1 being given to all members of the implicated groups.

# FILE HEADERS
Each file containing code has to be annotated with a complete header file, for example following this format:

```
#!/bin/bash
#
# who_is_on - Displays who is currently logged in
#
# usage: who_is_on param1 param2
#
# Albert Einstein 2016-02-22
```

# FUNCTION HEADERS
Each function has to be preceded by a header detailing the goal, description of inputs and outputs, bevhavior in special cases.

# CODE FORMATTING
Program code has to be formatted using a widely-adopted formatting style (see for example Google's Style Guides) and the formatting has to be consistent.

# CODE DOCUMENTATION
The code must have sufficient documentation to permit easy understanding.  
It is essential to use meaningful identifiers.  
For example pageCount is more meaningful than count and age is more meaningful than myInt.  
Whenever identifiers are not sufficient to convey the intention behind the code, use comments.

You are encouraged to write your code in English.
